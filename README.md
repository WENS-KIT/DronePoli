Recently, the number of personal mobility users has increased worldwide It increases the accidents due to violations
of personal mobility regulations. Personal mobility requires on-the-spot crackdowns, as license plates are absent on these
devices. However, the number of police officers conducting on-the-spot crackdowns is lacking due to the wide movement
range of these personal mobility devices. In this paper, utilizing Map-API and Mixed Reality(MR) wearable devices to
create a traffic monitoring system is proposed to solve this traffic enforcement personnel shortage. By using a proposed
system with cameras, on-the-spot crackdowns on personal mobility traffic regulations can be conducted effectively. Also,
unmanned devices or drones can navigate along roads, sharing the workload of traffic polices using Map-API. Utilizing the
suggested system equipped with cameras can consolidate personal mobility traffic regulations on the spot. Furthermore,
users, even those lacking specialized knowledge, can easily set routes using MR wearable devices and can receive live
feedback from cameras and access real-time GPS information from the drones.
